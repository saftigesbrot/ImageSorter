# ImageSorter
ImageSorter sorts images according to the date they were taken. 

The program extracts the Exifread from a Image or Video and searches for the creation date. Based on this creation date, the file is sorted into in a folder with the corresponding month and year. If there is no Exifread (a problem with old images), the program uses the last date of editing.

This project was uploaded years after it was started.
